This is a very simple Spin to C++ converter. There is much of the Spin
language that it does not handle, and its results will not always be
correct. Do not trust its output! It is provided more or less as a
toy, although on some trivial Spin programs it may be able to produce
correct results (but always check the results yourself by hand!)

This version (0.2) includes some more functionality. A simple "Hello,
world" program that compiles and runs is given in the Demo directory.
